### Morning Standup Tuesday, March 8, 2022

Tanner and Brian will be pairing up and executing tasks above

Matt and Nic will be pairing up and executing tasks

Tanner: Add the ability to add surveys. A new schema for notes will be needed at some point. Tasks as driver and/or navigator.

Nicholas: Today Matt and I will be tackling sorting the incoming surveys by subdomain. By then, we should be complete with most user stories.
Found a blocker, hit the database with a subdomain.
Fun to figure that out.
Then, work on the delete functionality. Good day ahead of us.

Brian: Paid up with Tanner, excited to start coding. Learn the inner workings of this code a bit better. Not all worked out in head but confident it will come once I put my hands on it.

Matt: I am super excited and anxious at the same time. Really want to get my hands on some code especially that delete as struggled on the assessment. I feel tired and rested at the same time.

*Reminder, this project is a learning experience and not just another task to complete.*
